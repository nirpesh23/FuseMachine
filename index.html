    <article id="intro"><p>The area of Artificial Intelligence (AI) strives to understand and create intelligent entities. It is about creating machines that think and reason in accordance to the knowledge present. Needless to say, we have not been able to create these machines that are able to do all the things that the human mind can do in an easy way. But, to a certain extent, modern AI systems have been able to emulate intelligent behavior in narrow domains performing very specific tasks incredibly well. Humans on the other hand are capable at any domain with resonable well results. AI has a great future in various fields along with their own challenges and opportunities.

        Many tasks seem easy for humans but are hard for a computer to do. Driving a car requires us to have a lot of prior knowledge about the world and how it works. Furthermore, even if we encode all these rules into a computer explicitly, there are many scenarios that can occur while driving, which we might miss while programming a computer.

        <article class="art1">
            <h3 >Artificial Narrow Intelligence(ANI)</h3>
            <p>Artificial Narrow Intelligence is a type of AI that is programmed to perform single task whether the task being able to play chess/Go or being able to predict stock or being able to translate text from one language to another, etc. Since, the ANI retrieves information from a certain set of data only, they cannot perform any task other than the one they are designed to perform. That is we cannot ask Google Translator to recognize apple in a picture.\ It is also known as "Weak AI" and is the only form of AI that humanity has achieved so far. ANIs aren't conscious and they aren't driven by emotions as humans are.</p>

            <h3 >Artificial General Intelligence(AGI)</h3>
            <p>Artificial General Intelligence is a type of AI that can show human level intelligence. AGI is the AI that can reason and understand the environmental scenarios as an average human can do.\ AGI is also known as "Strong AI" and something like this hasn't been developed yet. It may be because to make a system that thinks like human, first we have to figure out how human thinks, how they think abstractly and stragegize and imagine and most importantly our consciousness. And these things are so less understood that we need to first understand it by ourselves and teach it to the machine.</p>

            <h3>Artificial Super Intelligence(ASI)</h3>
            <p>According to Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom, SuperIntelligence in AI can be defined as “any intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest” Artificial Super Intelligence is an AI which surprasses human intelligence in all aspects including scientific creativity, general wisdom, social skills and problem-solving. It is the level of Intelligence as seen in sci-fi movie characters like Jarvis and the one Elon Musk is afraid will be the reason for downfall of human civilization.</p>
